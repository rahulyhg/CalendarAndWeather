        <item>Our chief defect is that we are more given to talking about things than to doing them.@@-@@Jawaharlal Nehru</item>
        <item>The purely agitational attitude is not good enough for a detailed consideration of a subject.@@-@@Jawaharlal Nehru</item>

        <item>Action itself, so long as I am convinced that it is right action, gives me satisfaction.@@-@@Jawaharlal Nehru</item>
        <item>It is only too easy to make suggestions and later try to escape the consequences of what we say.@@-@@Jawaharlal Nehru</item>
        <item>The person who runs away exposes himself to that very danger more than a person who sits quietly.@@-@@Jawaharlal Nehru</item>
        <item>The man who has gotten everything he wants is all in favor of peace and order.@@-@@Jawaharlal Nehru</item>
        <item>There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.@@Life,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>When you draw or paint a tree, you do not imitate the tree; you do not copy it exactly as it is, which would be mere photography. To be free to paint a tree or a flower or a sunset, you have to feel what it conveys to you: the significance, the meaning of it.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>No one can live without relationship. You may withdraw into the mountains, become a monk, a sannyasi, wander off into the desert by yourself, but you are related. You cannot escape from that absolute fact. You cannot exist in isolation.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself.@@Inspirational,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Love is the missing factor; there is a lack of affection, of warmth in relationship; and because we lack that love, that tenderness, that generosity, that mercy in relationship, we escape into mass action, which produces further confusion, further misery.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>We never look deeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity, its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree. Not the sound of wind through the leaves, not the breeze of a morning that flutters the leaves, but its own sound, the sound of the trunk and the silent sound of the roots.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life.@@Life,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality or whatever you like to call it, can never be answered by books, by priests, philosopher\'s or saviours. Nobody and nothing can answer the question but you yourself, and that is why you must know yourself - Immaturity lies only in total ignorance of self.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong, but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching, you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>It is really very important while you are young to live in an environment in which there is no fear. Most of us, as we grow older, become frightened; we are afraid of living, afraid of losing a job, afraid of tradition, afraid of what the neighbours, or what the wife or husband would say, afraid of death.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Have you not noticed that love is silence? It may be while holding the hand of another, or looking lovingly at a child, or taking in the beauty of an evening. Love has no past or future, and so it is with this extraordinary state of silence.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive to the system, and that is not attention.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>If you begin to understand what you are without trying to change it, then what you are undergoes a transformation.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>One is never afraid of the unknown; one is afraid of the known coming to an end.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Die to everything of yesterday so that your mind is always fresh, always young, innocent, full of vigor and passion.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment. We are the result of all kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in us, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves: nothing original, pristine, clear.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Truth cannot be brought down; rather, the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountaintop to the valley. If you would attain to the mountaintop, you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>It is odd that we have so little relationship with nature, with the insects and the leaping frog and the owl that hoots among the hills calling for its mate. We never seem to have a feeling for all living things on the earth.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>You may be educated abroad, you may be a great scientist, politician, but you always have a sneaking fear that if you don\'t go to temples or do the ordinary things that you have been told to do, something evil might happen, so you conform. What happens to the mind that conforms? Investigate it, please.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>When the mind is empty, silent, when it is in a state of complete negation - which is not blankness, nor the opposite of being positive, but a totally different state in which all thought has ceased - only then is it possible for that which is unnameable to come into being.@@Positive,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>What religion a man holds, to what race he belongs, these things are not important; the really important thing is this knowledge: the knowledge of God\'s plan for men. For God has a plan, and that plan is evolution.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>In seeking comfort, we generally find a quiet corner in life where there is a minimum of conflict, and then we are afraid to step out of that seclusion.@@Life,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>The end is the beginning of all things, Suppressed and hidden, Awaiting to be released through the rhythm Of pain and pleasure.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>We do not know what love is. We know the symptoms of it, the pleasure, the pain, the fear, the anxiety and so on. We try to solve the symptoms, which becomes a wandering in darkness. We spend our days and nights in this, and it is soon over in death.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Man has throughout the ages been seeking something beyond himself, beyond material welfare - something we call truth or God or reality, a timeless state - something that cannot be disturbed by circumstances, by thought or by human corruption.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>A consistent thinker is a thoughtless person, because he conforms to a pattern; he repeats phrases and thinks in a groove.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear; that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it. We are to learn about fear, not how to escape from it.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess? You will find the true answer not in escape, ideals, beliefs but through the understanding of the causes of dependence and possessiveness.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Religion is the frozen thought of man out of which they build temples.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>If we could establish a deep abiding relationship with nature, we would never kill an animal for our appetite; we would never harm, vivisect, a monkey, a dog, a guinea pig for our benefit. We would find other ways to heal our wounds, heal our bodies.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>All ideologies are idiotic, whether religious or political, for it is conceptual thinking, the conceptual word, which has so unfortunately divided man.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>If one has fear, there can be no initiative in the creative sense of the word. To have initiative in this sense is to do something original - to do it spontaneously, naturally, without being guided, forced, controlled. It is to do something which you love to do.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>When one travels around the world, one notices to what an extraordinary degree human nature is the same, whether in India or America, in Europe or Australia.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>All of us have been trained by education and environment to seek personal gain and security and to fight for ourselves. Though we cover it over with pleasant phrases, we have been educated for various professions within a system which is based on exploitation and acquisitive fear.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Life is relationship, living is relationship. We cannot live if you and I have built a wall around ourselves and just peep over that wall occasionally. Unconsciously, deeply, under the wall, we are related.@@Life,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Can the mind see the truth of its own incapacity to know the unknown? Surely if I see very clearly that my mind cannot know the unknown, there is absolute quietness.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>The environment that we call society is created by past generations; we accept it, as it helps us to maintain our greed, possessiveness, illusion.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>It is violence when we use a sharp word, when we make a gesture to brush away a person. So violence isn\'t merely organized butchery in the name of God, in the name of society or country. Violence is much more subtle, much deeper.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>With increasing age, dullness of mind and heart sets in.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>We are domesticated animals, revolving in a cage which we have built for ourselves - with its contentions, wranglings, its impossible political leaders, its gurus who exploit our self-conceit and their own with great refinement or rather crudely.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>When I understand myself, I understand you, and out of that understanding comes love.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>If we depend for our happiness on another, on society or on environment, they become essential to us; we cling to them, and any alteration of these we violently oppose because we depend upon them for our psychological security and comfort.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Why does your mind conform? Have you ever asked? Are you aware that you are conforming to a pattern? It doesn\'t matter what that pattern is, whether you have established a pattern for yourself or it has been established for you.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Meditation demands an astonishingly alert mind; it is the understanding of the totality of life in which every form of fragmentation has ceased.@@Life,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>When we talk about understanding, surely it takes place only when the mind listens completely - the mind being your heart, your nerves, your ears - when you give your whole attention to it.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>This is love: the flowering of love is meditation.@@Love,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Listening has importance only when one is not projecting one\'s own desires through which one listens.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Have you ever asked yourselves what you are going to do when you grow up? In all likelihood you will get married, and before you know where you are, you will be mothers and fathers; and you will then be tied to a job, or to the kitchen, in which you will gradually wither away. Is that all that your life is going to be?@@Life,@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize a belief.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>I want to do a certain thing in the world, and I am going to do it with unwavering concentration. I am concerning myself with only one essential thing: to set man free. I desire to free him from all cages, from all fears, and not to found religions, new sects, nor to establish new theories and new philosophies.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>You may be able to read Bernard Shaw\'s plays, you may be able to quote Shakespeare or Voltaire or some new philosopher; but if you in yourself are not intelligent, if you are not creative, what is the point of this education?@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>For most of us, relationship with another is based on dependence, either economic or psychological. This dependence creates fear, breeds in us possessiveness, results in friction, suspicion, frustration.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>In this constant battle which we call living, we try to set a code of conduct according to the society in which we are brought up, whether it be a Communist society or a so-called free society; we accept a standard of behaviour as part of our tradition as Hindus or Muslims or Christians or whatever we happen to be.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Organized murder is war, and though we demonstrate against a particular war, the nuclear, or any other kind of war, we have never demonstrated against war.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>If you listen through the screen of your desires, then you obviously listen to your own voice; you are listening to your own desires.@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>
        <item>Is it not important to find out how to listen not only to what is being said but to everything - to the noise in the streets, to the chatter of birds, to the noise of the tramcar, to the restless sea, to the voice of your husband, to your wife, to your friends, to the cry of a baby?@@-@@Jiddu Krishnamurti</item>

        <item>The means that make one qualified for enquiry are meditation, yoga, etc. One should gain proficiency in these through graded practice and thus secure a stream of mental modes that is natural and helpful.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Society is the body; individuals are its members, its limbs. Just as the various limbs help and co-operate with one another and thus are happy, so each must unite with others in being helpful to all in thought, speech and action...

        <item>Devotion complete culminates in knowledge supreme.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Time and space always change, but there is something which is eternal and changeless. For example, the world and time, past or future, nothing exists for us in sleep. But we exist. Let us try to find out that which is changeless and which always exists.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>If you are vigilant and make a stern effort to reject every thought when it rises, you will soon find that you are going deeper and deeper into your own inner self, where there is no need for your effort to reject the thoughts.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>

        <item>Even as one and the same person is called by different names according to the different functions he performs, so also one and the same mind is called by the different names: mind, intellect, memory, and egoity, on account of the difference in the modes - and not because of any real difference.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>

        <item>Self-reform automatically brings about social reform.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Concentration of the mind is in a way common to both Knowledge and Yoga. Yoga aims at union of the individual with the universal, the Reality. This Reality cannot be new. It must exist even now, and it does exist.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Every moment there is creation, every moment destruction. There is no absolute creation, no absolute destruction. Both are movement, and that is eternal.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Even the structure of the atom has been found by the mind. Therefore the mind is subtler than the atom. That which is behind the mind, namely the individual soul, is subtler than the mind.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Think of God; attachments will gradually drop away. If you wait till all desires disappear before starting your devotion and prayer, you will have to wait for a very long time indeed.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>It is every intelligent man\'s experience that evildoing recoils on the doer sooner or later.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>Experiences such as, \'I went; I came; I was; I did,\' come naturally to everyone. From these experiences, does it not appear that the consciousness \'I\' is the subject of those various acts? Enquiry into the true nature of that consciousness, and remaining as oneself, is the way to understand, through enquiry, one\'s true nature.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>The mind itself is of the form of all, i.e., of soul, God and world; when it becomes of the form of the Self through knowledge, there is release, which is of the nature of Brahman: this is the teaching.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>
        <item>The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or as that. The very thought of thinking will end in bondage.@@-@@Ramana Maharshi</item>

        <item>The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>

        <item>The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.@@Life,@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\'s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory complete.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>
        <item>For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.@@-@@Sun Tzu</item>

So they don\'t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one\'s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Things don\'t have to change the world to be important.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Innovation has nothing to do with how many R &amp; D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R &amp; D. It\'s not about money. It\'s about the people you have, how you\'re led, and how much you get it.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We\'re just enthusiastic about what we do.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I think it\'s brought the world a lot closer together, and will continue to do that. There are downsides to everything; there are unintended consequences to everything. The most corrosive piece of technology that I\'ve ever seen is called television - but then, again, television, at its best, is magnificent.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn\'t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we\'ve done something wonderful, that\'s what matters to me.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Our goal is to make the best devices in the world, not to be the biggest.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>And no, we don\'t know where it will lead. We just know there\'s something much bigger than any of us here.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I\'ve done that sort of thing in my life, but I\'ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don\'t know why. Because they\'re harder. They\'re much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you\'ve completely failed.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians. They also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world. But if it hadn\'t been computer science, these people would have been doing amazing things in other fields.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Older people sit down and ask, \'What is it?\' but the boy asks, \'What can I do with it?\'.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>You can\'t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they\'ll want something new.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near or at the top as history unfolds and we look back. It is the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this invention has taken form.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we\'ve been thinking about a problem.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we\'ve always tried to be at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Japan\'s very interesting. Some people think it copies things. I don\'t think that anymore. I think what they do is reinvent things. They will get something that\'s already been invented and study it until they thoroughly understand it. In some cases, they understand it better than the original inventor.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it\'s like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network. We\'re just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I think money is a wonderful thing because it enables you to do things. It enables you to invest in ideas that don\'t have a short-term payback.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>If you haven\'t found it yet, keep looking. Don\'t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\'ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>If you\'re gonna make connections which are innovative... you have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each others\' negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the parts.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>When you\'re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you\'re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You\'ll know it\'s there, so you\'re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>To turn really interesting ideas and fledgling technologies into a company that can continue to innovate for years, it requires a lot of disciplines.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents\' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We hire people who want to make the best things in the world.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>And one more thing.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Apple\'s market share is bigger than BMW\'s or Mercedes\'s or Porsche\'s in the automotive market. What\'s wrong with being BMW or Mercedes?@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I don\'t think I\'ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn\'t be ours anymore.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what iPhone is. OK? So, we\'re going to reinvent the phone.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I didn\'t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I met Woz when I was 13, at a friend\'s garage. He was about 18. He was, like, the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that point. We became good friends, because we shared an interest in computers and we had a sense of humor. We pulled all kinds of pranks together.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>But Apple really beats to a different drummer. I used to say that Apple should be the Sony of this business, but in reality, I think Apple should be the Apple of this business.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>In most people\'s vocabularies, design means veneer. It\'s interior decorating. It\'s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We don\'t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we\'ve chosen to do with our life.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Bottom line is, I didn\'t return to Apple to make a fortune. I\'ve been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn\'t going to let it ruin my life. There\'s no way you could ever spend it all, and I don\'t view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>It is piracy, not overt online music stores, which is our main competitor.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Who wants a stylus. You have to get em and put em away, and you lose em. Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>

        <item>Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car. You don\'t have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don\'t have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I\'m not downplaying that.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We made the buttons on the screen look so good you\'ll want to lick them.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We\'re going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>When you\'re young, you look at television and think, there\'s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that\'s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I think we\'re having fun. I think our customers really like our products. And we\'re always trying to do better.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Well, Apple invented the PC as we know it, and then it invented the graphical user interface as we know it eight years later (with the introduction of the Mac). But then, the company had a decade in which it took a nap.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>There\'s no other company that could make a MacBook Air and the reason is that not only do we control the hardware, but we control the operating system. And it is the intimate interaction between the operating system and the hardware that allows us to do that. There is no intimate interaction between Windows and a Dell notebook.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The desktop computer industry is dead. Innovation has virtually ceased. Microsoft dominates with very little innovation. That\'s over. Apple lost. The desktop market has entered the dark ages, and it\'s going to be in the dark ages for the next 10 years, or certainly for the rest of this decade.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus\' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>It\'s not about charisma and personality, it\'s about results and products and those very bedrock things that are why people at Apple and outside of Apple are getting more excited about the company and what Apple stands for and what its potential is to contribute to the industry.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I think right now it\'s a battle for the mindshare of developers and for the mindshare of customers, and right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The reason we wouldn\'t make a seven-inch tablet isn\'t because we don\'t want to hit a price point, it\'s because we don\'t think you can make a great tablet with a seven-inch screen.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>You\'ll see more and more perfection of that - computer as servant. But the next thing is going to be computer as a guide or agent.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I\'m an optimist in the sense that I believe humans are noble and honorable, and some of them are really smart. I have a very optimistic view of individuals.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I\'m very excited about having the Internet in my den.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn\'t build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren\'t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The design of the Mac wasn\'t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it\'s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>It\'s hard to tell with these Internet startups if they\'re really interested in building companies or if they\'re just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don\'t really want to build a company, they won\'t luck into it. That\'s because it\'s so hard that if you don\'t have a passion, you\'ll give up.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I\'ve always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I\'ve done a lot of things I\'m not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I was 23 and the way I handled that.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>This revolution, the information revoultion, is a revolution of free energy as well, but of another kind: free intellectual energy. It\'s very crude today, yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt bulb to run it and it can save you hours a day. What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now, or 50 years from now?@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Pointing is a metaphor we all know. We\'ve done a lot of studies and tests on that, and it\'s much faster to do all kinds of functions, such as cutting and pasting, with a mouse, so it\'s not only easier to use but more efficient.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who\'s voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That\'s who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience. And if it\'s not up to par, it\'s our fault, plain and simply.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Pretty much, Apple and Dell are the only ones in this industry making money. They make it by being Wal-Mart. We make it by innovation.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it\'s easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We\'re supposed to be really good at this. That doesn\'t mean we don\'t listen to customers, but it\'s hard for them to tell you what they want when they\'ve never seen anything remotely like it.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Apple took the edge off the word \'computer.\'@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>It\'s not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools. They work, or they don\'t work. It\'s people you have faith in or not. Yeah, sure, I\'m still optimistic I mean, I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don\'t get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We\'re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it\'s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>It took us three years to build the NeXT computer. If we\'d given customers what they said they wanted, we\'d have built a computer they\'d have been happy with a year after we spoke to them - not something they\'d want now.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We\'ve demonstrated a strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don\'t let it burn a hole in our pocket, we don\'t allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions. And so I think that we\'d like to continue to keep our powder dry, because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it\'s humorous, all the attention to it, because it\'s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that\'s happened to me.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\'t capture, and I found it fascinating.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>First was the mouse. The second was the click wheel. And now, we\'re going to bring multi-touch to the market. And each of these revolutionary interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product - the Mac, the iPod and now the iPhone.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We think Android is very, very fragmented, and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple strives for the integrated model so that the user isn\'t forced to be the systems integrator.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The manual for WordStar, the most popular word-processing program, is 400 pages thick. To write a novel, you have to read a novel - one that reads like a mystery to most people. They\'re not going to learn slash q-z any more than they\'re going to learn Morse code. That is what Macintosh is all about.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>As individuals, people are inherently good. I have a somewhat more pessimistic view of people in groups. And I remain extremely concerned when I see what\'s happening in our country, which is in many ways the luckiest place in the world. We don\'t seem to be excited about making our country a better place for our kids.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The desktop metaphor was invented because one, you were a stand-alone device, and two, you had to manage your own storage. That\'s a very big thing in a desktop world. And that may go away. You may not have to manage your own storage. You may not store much before too long.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I get asked a lot why Apple\'s customers are so loyal. It\'s not because they belong to the Church of Mac! That\'s ridiculous.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Throughout my years in business, I discovered something. I would always ask why you do things. The answers that I would invariably get are: \'Oh, that\'s just the way things are done around here.\' Nobody knows why they do what they do. Nobody thinks very deeply about things in business.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>We want to reinvent the phone. What\'s the killer app? The killer app is making calls! It\'s amazing how hard it is to make calls on most phones. We want to let you use contacts like never before - sync your iPhone with your PC or mac.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Now, we are selling over 5 million songs a day now. Isn\'t that unbelievable? That\'s 58 songs every second of every minute of every hour of every day.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The engineering is long gone in most PC companies. In the consumer electronics companies, they don\'t understand the software parts of it. And so you really can\'t make the products that you can make at Apple anywhere else right now. Apple\'s the only company that has everything under one roof.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Woz is living his own life now. He hasn\'t been around Apple for about five years. But what he did will go down in history.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>Each year has been so robust with problems and successes and learning experiences and human experienes that a year is a lifetime at Apple. So this has been ten lifetimes.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I\'ll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I\'ll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry. There may be a few years when I\'m not there, but I\'ll always come back.@@Life,@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>I\'m sorry, it\'s true. Having children really changes your view on these things. We\'re born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It\'s been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much - if at all.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously rich, they\'re gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives. Without it, they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>The system is that there is no system. That doesn\'t mean we don\'t have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that\'s not what it\'s about. Process makes you more efficient.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>
        <item>It takes these very simple-minded instructions \'Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it\'s greater than this other number\'  but executes them at a rate of, let\'s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic.@@-@@Steve Jobs</item>

        <item>It\'s one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself, to forgive. Forgive everybody.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The thing to do, it seems to me, is to prepare yourself so you can be a rainbow in somebody else\'s cloud. Somebody who may not look like you. May not call God the same name you call God - if they call God at all. I may not dance your dances or speak your language. But be a blessing to somebody. That\'s what I think.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>My grandmother took me to church on Sunday all day long, every Sunday into the night. Then Monday evening was the missionary meeting. Tuesday evening was usher board meeting.

        <item>You are the sum total of everything you\'ve ever seen, heard, eaten, smelled, been told, forgot - it\'s all there. Everything influences each of us, and because of that I try to make sure that my experiences are positive.@@Positive,@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>It is impossible to struggle for civil rights, equal rights for blacks, without including whites. Because equal rights, fair play, justice, are all like the air: we all have it, or none of us has it. That is the truth of it.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I\'m convinced of this: Good done anywhere is good done everywhere. For a change, start by speaking to people rather than walking by them like they\'re stones that don\'t matter. As long as you\'re breathing, it\'s never too late to do some good.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with deeper meaning.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>During bad circumstances, which is the human inheritance, you must decide not to be reduced. You have your humanity, and you must not allow anything to reduce that. We are obliged to know we are global citizens. Disasters remind us we are world citizens, whether we like it or not.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future and renders the present inaccessible.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I have great respect for the past. If you don\'t know where you\'ve come from, you don\'t know where you\'re going. I have respect for the past, but I\'m a person of the moment. I\'m here, and I do my best to be completely centered at the place I\'m at, then I go forward to the next place.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>There\'s a world of difference between truth and facts. Facts can obscure the truth.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The most important thing I can tell you about aging is this: If you really feel that you want to have an off-the-shoulder blouse and some big beads and thong sandals and a dirndl skirt and a magnolia in your hair, do it. Even if you\'re wrinkled.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Find a beautiful piece of art. If you fall in love with Van Gogh or Matisse or John Oliver Killens, or if you fall love with the music of Coltrane, the music of Aretha Franklin, or the music of Chopin - find some beautiful art and admire it, and realize that that was created by human beings just like you, no more human, no less.@@Love,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>If we don\'t plant the right things, we will reap the wrong things. It goes without saying. And you don\'t have to be, you know, a brilliant biochemist and you don\'t have to have an IQ of 150. Just common sense tells you to be kind, ninny, fool. Be kind.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>Our stories come from our lives and from the playwright\'s pen, the mind of the actor, the roles we create, the artistry of life itself and the quest for peace.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>What humility does for one is it reminds us that there are people before me. I have already been paid for. And what I need to do is prepare myself so that I can pay for someone else who has yet to come but who may be here and needs me.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>In all my work, I try to say - \'You may be given a load of sour lemons, why not try to make a dozen lemon meringue pies?\'@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I\'m grateful to intelligent people. That doesn\'t mean educated. That doesn\'t mean intellectual. I mean really intelligent. What black old people used to call \'mother wit\' means intelligence that you had in your mother\'s womb. That\'s what you rely on. You know what\'s right to do.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>I respect myself and insist upon it from everybody. And because I do it, I then respect everybody, too.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>Whenever I want to laugh, I read a wonderful book, \'Children\'s Letters to God.\' You can open it anywhere. One I read recently said, \'Dear God, thank you for the baby brother, but what I prayed for was a puppy.\'@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>Any book that helps a child to form a habit of reading, to make reading one of his deep and continuing needs, is good for him.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>You can\'t forgive without loving. And I don\'t mean sentimentality. I don\'t mean mush. I mean having enough courage to stand up and say, \'I forgive. I\'m finished with it.\'@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The truth is, no one of us can be free until everybody is free.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Nothing succeeds like success. Get a little success, and then just get a little more.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Modesty is a learned affectation. And as soon as life slams the modest person against the wall, that modesty drops.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Bitterness is cancer - it eats upon the host. It doesn\'t do anything to the object of its displeasure.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Won\'t it be wonderful when black history and native American history and Jewish history and all of U.S. history is taught from one book. Just U.S. history.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I got my own back.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Most people don\'t grow up. It\'s too damn difficult. What happens is most people get older. That\'s the truth of it. They honor their credit cards, they find parking spaces, they marry, they have the nerve to have children, but they don\'t grow up.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>My mother said I must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, unable to go to school, were more educated and more intelligent than college professors.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>If we accept being talked to any kind of a way, then we are telling ourselves we are not quite worth the best. And if we have the effrontery to talk to anybody with less than courtesy, we tell ourselves and the world we are not very intelligent.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I work very hard, and I play very hard. I\'m grateful for life. And I live it - I believe life loves the liver of it. I live it.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>What is a fear of living? It\'s being preeminently afraid of dying. It is not doing what you came here to do, out of timidity and spinelessness. The antidote is to take full responsibility for yourself - for the time you take up and the space you occupy. If you don\'t know what you\'re here to do, then just do some good.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>At 50, I began to know who I was. It was like waking up to myself.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I like chicken a lot because chicken is generous - that is to say, it\'s obedient. It will do whatever you tell it to do.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>There is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>That\'s the biggest gift I can give anybody: \'Wake up, be aware of who you are, what you\'re doing and what you can do to prevent yourself from becoming ill.\'@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>We write for the same reason that we walk, talk, climb mountains or swim the oceans - because we can. We have some impulse within us that makes us want to explain ourselves to other human beings. That\'s why we paint, that\'s why we dare to love someone - because we have the impulse to explain who we are.@@Love,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>You have to develop ways so that you can take up for yourself, and then you take up for someone else. And so sooner or later, you have enough courage to really stand up for the human race and say, \'I\'m a representative.\'@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Courage - you develop courage by doing small things like just as if you wouldn\'t want to pick up a 100-pound weight without preparing yourself.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>Life loves the liver of it.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Don\'t let the incidents which take place in life bring you low. And certainly don\'t whine. You can be brought low, that\'s OK, but don\'t be reduced by them. Just say, \'That\'s life.\'@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The only thing is, people have to develop courage. It is most important of all the virtues. Because without courage, you can\'t practice any other virtues consistently.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>A cynical young person is almost the saddest sight to see, because it means that he or she has gone from knowing nothing to believing nothing.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>In a magazine, one can get - from cover to cover - 15 to 20 different ideas about life and how to live it.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Encouragement to all women is - let us try to offer help before we have to offer therapy. That is to say, let\'s see if we can\'t prevent being ill by trying to offer a love of prevention before illness.@@Love,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Somehow, we have come to the erroneous belief that we are all but flesh, blood, and bones, and that\'s all. So we direct our values to material things.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>A black person grows up in this country - and in many places - knowing that racism will be as familiar as salt to the tongue. Also, it can be as dangerous as too much salt. I think that you must struggle for betterment for yourself and for everyone.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>If you\'re serious, you really understand that it\'s important that you laugh as much as possible and admit that you\'re the funniest person you ever met. You have to laugh. Admit that you\'re funny. Otherwise, you die in solemnity.@@Funny,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Black people comprehend the South. We understand its weight. It has rested on our backs... I knew that my heart would break if ever I put my foot down on that soil, moist, still, with old hurts. I had to face the fear/loathing at its source or it would consume me whole.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>It\'s good to remember that in crises, natural crises, human beings forget for awhile their ignorances, their biases, their prejudices. For a little while, neighbors help neighbors and strangers help strangers.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>If one is lucky, a solitary fantasy can totally transform one million realities.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>We have to confront ourselves. Do we like what we see in the mirror? And, according to our light, according to our understanding, according to our courage, we will have to say yea or nay - and rise!@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>In so many ways, segregation shaped me, and education liberated me.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The idea is to write it so that people hear it and it slides through the brain and goes straight to the heart.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I\'m working at trying to be a Christian, and that\'s serious business. It\'s like trying to be a good Jew, a good Muslim, a good Buddhist, a good Shintoist, a good Zoroastrian, a good friend, a good lover, a good mother, a good buddy - it\'s serious business.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Independence is a heady draught, and if you drink it in your youth, it can have the same effect on the brain as young wine does. It does not matter that its taste is not always appealing. It is addictive and with each drink you want more.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I thank God I\'m myself and for the life I\'m given to live and for friends and lovers and beloveds, and I thank God for knowing that all those people have already paid for me.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Information helps you to see that you\'re not alone. That there\'s somebody in Mississippi and somebody in Tokyo who all have wept, who\'ve all longed and lost, who\'ve all been happy. So the library helps you to see, not only that you are not alone, but that you\'re not really any different from everyone else.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>We allow our ignorance to prevail upon us and make us think we can survive alone, alone in patches, alone in groups, alone in races, even alone in genders.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste and even belligerance. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors, and deserves respect if not enthusiastic acceptance.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>The need for change bulldozed a road down the center of my mind.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I read the Bible to myself; I\'ll take any translation, any edition, and read it aloud, just to hear the language, hear the rhythm, and remind myself how beautiful English is.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>All of us knows, not what is expedient, not what is going to make us popular, not what the policy is, or the company policy - but in truth each of us knows what is the right thing to do. And that\'s how I am guided.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I don\'t think there\'s such a thing as autobiographical fiction. If I say it happened, it happened, even if only in my mind.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Everybody born comes from the Creator trailing wisps of glory. We come from the Creator with creativity. I think that each one of us is born with creativity.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Whenever something went wrong when I was young - if I had a pimple or if my hair broke - my mom would say, \'Sister mine, I\'m going to make you some soup.\' And I really thought the soup would make my pimple go away or my hair stronger.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Growing up, I decided, a long time ago, I wouldn\'t accept any manmade differences between human beings, differences made at somebody else\'s insistence or someone else\'s whim or convenience.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>If you will have a person enslaved, the first thing you must do is convince yourself that the person is subhuman. The second thing you have to do is convince your allies so you\'ll have some help, and the third and probably unkindest cut of all is to convince that person that he or she is subhuman and deserves it.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I could fall in love with a sumo wrestler if he told stories and made me laugh. Obviously, it would be easier if someone was African-American and lived next door and went to the same church. Because then I wouldn\'t have to translate.@@Love,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Hold those things that tell your history and protect them. During slavery, who was able to read or write or keep anything? The ability to have somebody to tell your story to is so important. It says: \'I was here. I may be sold tomorrow. But you know I was here.\'@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I am grateful to be a woman. I must have done something great in another life.@@Life,@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>I know some people might think it odd - unworthy even - for me to have written a cookbook, but I make no apologies. The U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins thought I had demeaned myself by writing poetry for Hallmark Cards, but I am the people\'s poet so I write for the people.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I love the melodies in the Old Testament, how preachers highlight them when they read from the Scripture. But I was influenced forever by the New Testament. I love the Beatitudes, informing us that the meek shall inherit the earth.@@Love,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Whenever I\'m around some who is modest, I think, \'Run like hell and all of fire.\' You don\'t want modesty, you want humility.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>When the human race neglects its weaker members, when the family neglects its weakest one - it\'s the first blow in a suicidal movement. I see the neglect in cities around the country, in poor white children in West Virginia and Virginia and Kentucky - in the big cities, too, for that matter.@@Family,@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I\'ve always written. There\'s a journal which I kept from about 9 years old. The man who gave it to me lived across the street from the store and kept it when my grandmother\'s papers were destroyed. I\'d written some essays. I loved poetry, still do. But I really, really loved it then.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>One of my lungs is half gone, and the other half, because I smoked for years, has a lesion. So I can\'t swim anymore and had the swimming pool covered over.

        <item>I\'m just like you - I want to be a good human being. I\'m doing my best, and I\'m working at it. And I\'m trying to be a Christian.

        <item>I\'m not a writer who teaches. I\'m a teacher who writes.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>All men are prepared to accomplish the incredible if their ideals are threatened.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>To take a few nouns, and a few pronouns, and adverbs and adjectives, and put them together, ball them up, and throw them against the wall to make them bounce.

        <item>I love wisdom. And you can never be great at anything unless you love it. Not be in love with it, but love the thing, admire the thing. And it seems that if you love the thing, and you don\'t just want to possess it, it will find you.@@Love,@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>I never had that feeling that I had to carry the weight of somebody\'s ignorance around with me. And that was true for racists who wanted to use the \'n\' word when talking about me or about my people, or the stupidity of people who really wanted to belittle other folks because they weren\'t pretty or they weren\'t rich or they weren\'t clever.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I always knew from that moment, from the time I found myself at home in that little segregated library in the South, all the way up until I walked up the steps of the New York City library, I always felt, in any town, if I can get to a library, I\'ll be OK. It really helped me as a child, and that never left me.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>In all my work, in the movies I write, the lyrics, the poetry, the prose, the essays, I am saying that we may encounter many defeats - maybe it\'s imperative that we encounter the defeats - but we are much stronger than we appear to be and maybe much better than we allow ourselves to be.

        <item>I\'m a religious woman. And I feel I have responsibility. I have no modesty at all. I\'m even afraid of it - it\'s a learned affectation and it\'s just stuck on me like decals. Now I pray for humility because that comes from inside out.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>Fighting for one\'s freedom, struggling towards being free, is like struggling to be a poet or a good Christian or a good Jew or a good Muslim or good Zen Buddhist.

So you start all over again.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>I believe we are still so innocent. The species are still so innocent that a person who is apt to be murdered believes that the murderer, just before he puts the final wrench on his throat, will have enough compassion to give him one sweet cup of water.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>Of course, there are those critics - New York critics as a rule - who say, \'Well, Maya Angelou has a new book out and of course it\'s good but then she\'s a natural writer.\' Those are the ones I want to grab by the throat and wrestle to the floor because it takes me forever to get it to sing. I work at the language.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>
        <item>I would be a liar, a hypocrite, or a fool - and I\'m not any of those - to say that I don\'t write for the reader. I do.

        <item>Easy reading is damn hard writing. But if it\'s right, it\'s easy. It\'s the other way round, too. If it\'s slovenly written, then it\'s hard to read. It doesn\'t give the reader what the careful writer can give the reader.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>At one time, you could sit on the Rue de la Paix in Paris or at the Habima Theater in Tel Aviv or in Medina and you could see a person come in, black, white, it didn\'t matter.

        <item>It\'s still scary every time I go back to the past. Each morning, my heart catches. When I get there, I remember how the light was, where the draft was coming from, what odors were in the air. When I write, I get all the weeping out.@@-@@Maya Angelou</item>

        <item>At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad.
